# raycast-cool-engine
Raycast-based render engine programmed on C++ using OpenGL, inspired by 90's Id software shooters.
 
Repository is a Visual Studio Code Workspace. I use MinGW to compile the project.

Libraries used:
  - GLUT (Legacy Classic OpenGL handle library): https://chortle.ccsu.edu/Bloodshed/glutming.zip
  - Dear ImGui (fantastic UI library for C++) : https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
